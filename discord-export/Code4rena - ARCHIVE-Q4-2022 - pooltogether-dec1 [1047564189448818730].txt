👋  Hi everyone! Excited to be back.  @Pierrick and I have worked hard on putting together an ERC to standardize contract calls across bridges. We're very excited to have the C4 wardens scrutinize the code!

If you have any questions about the specification or implementation, please tag us!

if you have a picture like that and you're wondering why it takes a lot of time, just wait, everything is ok, indeed it takes about 10 minutes(on my system)

Dmed you.


[12/03/2022 22:44] Franfran#5067
May I ask you how do you plan to handle sending value along with `relayCalls` ?
It is explained that the function is payable for that purpose in the EIP, but each `Call` struct takes as a parameter the `target` address and `data` as the calldata. This would work for a single call, but how to manage multiple calls requiring multiple amount of value, like two swaps from ETH to whatever token on a L2 ?


[12/03/2022 22:45] Franfran#5067
Is it going to send all the value with the first call, or should we only use one call if there is value ?


[12/04/2022 08:44] demelew
The contract is used only to call a contract it can’t bridge any value


[12/04/2022 08:45] demelew
In the arbitrum relayer  msg.value is  only used to pay for a fee  you can see in the parameter  that the value arguments is set to zero

"However, Arbitrum requires an EOA to process the relay" :  can you provide a pointer to Arbitrum's doc where this is mentioned?


[12/05/2022 04:04] pierrickgt
This is the doc mentioning how to send a message from Ethereum to Arbitrum: https://developer.arbitrum.io/for-devs/cross-chain-messsaging#ethereum-to-arbitrum-messaging
In order to send the message, we need to use the Arbitrum JS SDK to properly estimate the gas that will be required for the message to execute on Arbitrum.
An example implementation is available in this tutorial: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/blob/master/packages/greeter/scripts/exec.js


[12/05/2022 05:40] teawaterwire
hum i see, it's because of this gas estimation. and on Optimism for instance we don't have this constraint because it's only about passing a gasLimit right? (i dm'ed you)


[12/05/2022 10:50] road220
does anyone have any problems with rps urls, specifically with mainnet? Thanks!
